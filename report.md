# Yellow Submarine - Gaussian vs non-Gaussian gates

## Overview

We seek to determine if the presence of non-Gaussian gates is beneficial to solving the maxcut problem.

## Conclusion

In the case of 4x4 unweighted matrices, we notice that the simulation converges faster towards the result in the presence of non-Gaussian gates.
But considering no such speedup was obserbed in the 17 other simulation (and in one of the 17, the convergence was slower with non-Gaussian gates),
we conclude that it future effort will be better expended optimizing the simulation with Gaussian gates alone.
