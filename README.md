# Yellow Submarine - Solving the MaxCut problem on photonic quantum computers using a machine learning approach

## Overview

We seek to find the best way to solve the MaxCut problem using a photonic quantum computer via machine learning.
Variational methods are used in order to observe the performance of different gates under different conditions.

## Authors

I am performing this research under the mentorship of Michał Stęchły of Bohr Technology.

## Credits

The code was written by Michał Stęchły with minor modifications by me and the original project can be found at [Bohr Technology public research](https://github.com/BOHRTECHNOLOGY/public_research/tree/master/Experiments/Yellow_submarine) and [Yellow submarine](https://github.com/BOHRTECHNOLOGY/yellow_submarine).

## Thanks

Sincere thanks to Michał Stęchły for his continued guidance (and much, much patience) during this ongoing research.
